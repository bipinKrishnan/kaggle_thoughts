# CommonLit Readability Prize

## Ideas/things to note

* Explore traditionally and commercially used methods for this task(Look into Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Lexile)
* Test set has wider range of diversity in text(i.e, has text from wide variety of domains) than the training set
* Find if we can make use of url, standard error and license column in training set(url, standard error and license column is blank in test set)
* Go through some of the excert column manually and see if we can find any useful clues
* Try plotting some count plots of target column
* From the excert column, generate additional columns like word count, syllables per word, parts of speech count, number of polysyllables, Flesch–Kincaid score etc

# CommonLit Readability Prize

## Ideas/things to note

* Do a simple EDA and then build a simple model using only excert as input to get familiar with the dataset
* Try a simple model and a neural net using the features described in Table 2 of this [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-2207.pdf)
* Explore traditionally and commercially used methods for this task(Look into Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Lexile)
* Public and private test set has wider range of diversity in text(i.e, has text from wide variety of domains) than the training set
* Find if we can make use of url, standard error and license column in training set(url, standard error and license column is blank in test set)
* Go through some of the excert column manually and see if we can find any useful clues
* From the excert column, generate additional columns like word count, syllables per word, parts of speech count, number of polysyllables, Fleschâ€“Kincaid score(using the formula [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)) etc and then check model performance by removing features progressively(including excert column) to find the best set of features(may be by using sklearn feature selectors)
* As a beginner, try following this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/approaching-almost-any-nlp-problem-on-kaggle) and then move to advanced models
* Use this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/step-1-create-folds) for fold creation
